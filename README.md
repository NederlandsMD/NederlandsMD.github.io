# Interactive Dashboard: Weather by Latitude

The website can be viewed at: https://nederlandsmd.github.io/Index_HW.html

This website was created from the analysis of weather by latitude (a separate project also hosted on this GitHub Account). The dashboard was created with HTML/Bootstrap and CSS, and is responsive to changes in window size as well as for use with mobile phones. 

The website allows users to flip through visualizations displaying four comparisons of weather at different latitudes: Max Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed. The dashboard also presents the source data used to compile the visualizations.
